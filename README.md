# FakeOverCook

Hi, thnx for this fun assignment first. Since I had serious time issues I could complete the main part of the game only. 
I also designed the visuals, so that took some time too. However, I believe there are a lot to interview already in the project :).

If I had more time, I would implement:
 the leaderboard, Change name functionalities. 
 Hightlight feature to understand which table the player is closer.
 Better and more responsive UI.
 A full ingame menu loop.
 
 etc.
 
 This project took my a good portion of time, so I would really be very appreciated if I get a qualitive technical feedbacks
 for my profect, which will give me different aspects and approaching abilities I believe. Thanks again. 
 
 Best
 Emre
